Instructions to run:
Ensure you have Node and NPM installed on your machine.
Run npm install in Validic directory
Run NPM start
Navigate to http://localhost:3000

## The problem:

Please write a web application that uses the [Github Jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/api) to help show jobs that are broken down by city and language. While you can use any language or framework you want, please note that at Validic our UIs are using frameworks like React and Angular.

### The cities we care about are:
- Los Angeles

- Boston
- San Francisco
- Denver
- Boulder
- Chicago
- New York

### The languages we care about are:
- Python
- Node
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- .NET
- Java
- Go

## Program guidelines:
- all work done in a git repository
- a readme with instructions on how to run the application
- a brief test suite

## Ideal output:

The ideal output would be a page with a little decoration that displays the results of a given search.  The filtering parameters for the search can be no filtering, filtered only on a single location, filtered only on a single language or filtered on both a single location and a single language.  The output should be a nicely formatted table, with pagination and some summary statistics at the footer.  The table shows each job, location, posting date and company.  Clicking the job title should display the job description in a right-hand pane, next to the table.  Clicking a second job description, should hide the first.

### Design:

The basic design should look something like this: [https://invis.io/QEBWBD9WP#/235844441_Fe_Code_Test_Table]

## Final Instructions:

Please tar/zip up your repo (or make a private repo and invite us) and send it along with an email talking about:
- challenges you ran into
- areas of the code you are most proud of
- areas of the code you are least proud of
- tradeoffs you were forced to make

This exercise should take you no more than 4 hours, if it does please just commit your work and send it over.
